## Programmable IP for the Integrity Web

Mediolano is a permissionless intellectual property platform designed to empower creators, artists, and organizations to protect and monetize their content—without needing any prior knowledge of crypto.

Built on Starknet, Mediolano harnesses fast, cost-effective transactions and zero-knowledge proofs to offer a permissionless and programmable framework for Intellectual Property (IP). Our open protocol makes it simple to tokenize and monetize digital assets with transparency, efficiency, and full sovereignty.

Through its zero-fee, open-source protocol and dApp, Mediolano enables instant tokenization and protection of creative works in accordance with the Berne Convention (1886), which spans 181 countries. This legal infrastructure guarantees global recognition of authorship and provides verifiable proof of ownership for 50 to 70 years, depending on the jurisdiction.

Our tools are designed for integration with diverse ecosystems—including communities, games, and AI agents—tapping into the full potential of Programmable IP for a more equitable, creator-led digital economy.

Governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), Mediolano champions transparent, decentralized decision-making in alignment with core web3 and cypherpunk principles. Our mission is to foster long-term value and sustainability for the entire ecosystem—from users to partners—by operating in the collective interest of the network.
