Governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), Mediolano champions transparent, decentralized decision-making in alignment with core web3 and cypherpunk principles. Our mission is to foster long-term value and sustainability for the entire ecosystem—from users to partners—by operating in the collective interest of the network.

### Key Features

- **Programmable IP**: Transform creative works (images, music, videos, AI models, research papers) into programmable digital assets that can be managed, tracked, and monetized.

-**Mediolano Protocol**: Programmable IP foundation of the Integrity Web. A high-performance, modular infrastructure for programmable intellectual property onchain.

- **Remix & Derivatives**: Enable creative remixing of intellectual property while maintaining clear lineage and attribution through smart contracts.

- **Proof of Ownership**: Generate blockchain-verified certificates of authorship and ownership, providing a cryptographically secure claim to your IP.

- **Provenance & Lineage**: Access an immutable history of every asset, tracking its creation, ownership changes, and derivative relationships with full transparency.

- **Asset Transfer**: Securely transfer ownership of IP assets peer-to-peer on the Starknet network with instant finality.

- **High-Speed & Low-Cost**: Leverage Starknet's ZK-rollup technology for unparalleled speed and negligible fees.

- **Gas Fee Abstraction**: Integrated AVNU Paymaster to provide a seamless user experience by abstracting gas costs. (Experimental)

## IP Creator Dapp Architecture

The IP Creator Dapp is built as permissionless, decentralized application leveraging the full power of Starknet and web3 to provide trully ownership.
